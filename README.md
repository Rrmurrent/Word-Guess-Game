## Description

Begin the game by pressing a letter on the keyboard. If you guess incorrecrtly, you lose a life. But if you guess correctly, you live to guess another day. You have five guesses. Let the games begin. 


As you correctly guess letters, the underscores will be filled in. Any incorrectly guessed letters are kept track of and shown for the player to see.
